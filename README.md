# drs4-tools
Set of tools to process data, generated by DRS4 eval board and similar devices.

drs4_analyzer
  Process binary files saved by DRSOsc program.
  The drs4_analyzer is much fatster than the read_binary.
  
  Features:
    Fast calibration,
    Baseline subtraction,
    FIR filtering.

  Usage: drs4_analyzer file.drs options

  OPTIONS:
    -nN  negative pulse processing of channel N.
    -c   disable timing calibration.
    -tV  set LED threshold to V {0.0:1.0].
    -fSN enable FIR filtering, S is filter shape (a:first event, r:rectangular, t:triangle), N is filter length.
    -bN  N-point baseline subtraction (N>1), single cell noise is calculated when N>0.
    -r   regularization of cell intervals (make it equidistant), not yet commissioned.
    -eN  process V events.
    -vN  verbosity level.

  Compile it:
       gcc drs4_analyzer.cpp mfilter.cpp -o drs4_analyzer -lm
